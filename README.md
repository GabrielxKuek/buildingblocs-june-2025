<b>Aphasia</b> is a condition that affects a personâ€™s ability to understand or express language due to damage in specific areas of the brain. Individuals with aphasia may clearly know what they want to say or identify an object in their mind, but struggle to find the right words or express them verbally. This language barrier can make everyday communication with caregivers and others challenging.

<b>SpeakEasy</b> serves to empower patients suffering from aphasia by helping them communciate with caregivers. By utilizing gen-ai, our platform makes it easy for patients to communicate their needs to caregivers. A caregiver can store specific items or services that a patient regularly asks for. This can range from anything that the patient may need. Maybe adding sugar to their coffee, or asking for help to get out of bed. Instead of having to recall the name of an object or service in their head, the patient can simply press on an image that most closely resembles what they are imagining.

At the same time, many patients with aphasia find it difficult to understand what is being spoken to them. We utilize nlp and text-to-emoji to generate images to support communication between patients and caregivers, providing visionary aid, to help patients understand what is being spoken to them.
